# Practical task

This repository created to provide slution for 2 questions that were asked in the questionare:
1. Write an automated test suite for a simple login form with fields "Username" and "Password" and a "Sign In" button on a web application. Describe your approach, tools, and priorities
2. Write one positive and one negative automated test case (pseudo-code or real code snippet in Java) for testing a feedback form with mandatory fields: "Name", "Email", "Message", and a "Send" button. The form shows a confirmation message after submission.

The TAF structured in following way:
- main contains the framework core and business layers
- test contains test layer

**The tests cannot be ran due to the fact that it is a deemonstration of idea how the cod may look**
To make it run you will need `maven`, `chrome driver` file and `credentials` to vmedia.ca website (optional).
run command: `mvn test` in that case default suite configured in the `testng.xml` will be ran.
